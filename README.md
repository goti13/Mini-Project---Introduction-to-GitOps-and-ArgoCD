Lesson 1.1: GitOps Principles and the Role of ArgoCD

Objective: Understand GitOps principles and ArgoCD's role in Kubernetes.

Lesson 1.1: GitOps Principles and the Role of ArgoCD

Objective

To gain a comprehensive understanding of GitOps principles and the pivotal role of ArgoCD in implementing these principles within a Kubernetes environment.

1. Study GitOps Principles:
- Key Concepts: Explore the fundamental concepts of GitOps including:
	- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Understand how infrastructure is managed and provisioned  through code, rather than manual processes.
	- Automated Deployment: Learn about the automated processes that ensure deployments are consistent and repeatable.
	- Merge Requests for Change Management: Discover how changes are reviewed and merged, ensuring a controlled and traceable approach to         environment modific


Benefits of GitOps:

- Enhanced Developer Productivity: Due to automated, predictable deployments.

- Improved Stability: As the entire system state is version-controlled.

- Easier Recovery: The ability to revert to a previous state is simplified.

-  Recommended Reading: For a deeper dive, explore the Weaveworks GitOps Principles. This resource provides an in-depth look at the            principles, practices, and benefits


2. Role of ArgoCD in GitOps:

- Automating Kubernetes Deployments:
	- Understand how ArgoCD automates the deployment of applications to Kubernetes clusters by monitoring Git repositories.
	- ArgoCD continuously compares the desired application state in Git with the live state in Kubernetes, ensuring consistency.

- Features of ArgoCD:

	- Declarative Setup: ArgoCD uses a declarative approach for infrastructure and application deployment.
	- Self-healing: Automatic correction of detected drifts in the desired and live states.

	- Multi-Cluster Management: Manage deployments across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

	- Integration with Various Tools: Works with Helm, Kustomize, and others for configuration management.

- Use Cases:

	- Illustrate common scenarios where ArgoCD provides significant advantages, such as multi-environment deployments and rollbacks.

   
- ArgoCD Documentation: [Review the ArgoCD - GitOps for Kubernetes](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for detailed insights into     its functionalities, installation, and usage.



Lesson 1.2: Installing and Configuring ArgoCD in an AWS Kubernetes Environment


Objective: Install ArgoCD on an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster on AWS.

Steps:

1. Set Up an EKS Cluster:

- Use AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to create an EKS cluster.

- Follow the AWS Guide: [Creating an Amazon EKS Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html).

2. Install ArgoCD on EKS:


- Apply the ArgoCD installation manifest using kubectl.

- Code Snippet:


```

kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml

```


- Explanation: This code snippet creates a namespace for ArgoCD and then applies the ArgoCD manifests to the EKS cluster.



3. Access ArgoCD Ul on EKS:

- Use kubectl port-forwarding or set up an Ingress controller to access the ArgoCD Ul.

- Code Snippet for Port Forwarding


```

kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443


```

- Explanation: This forwards port 8080 of your local machine to port 443 of the ArgoCD server, allowing access via ' localhost: 8080'.



Lesson 1.3: ArgoCD Architecture: Understanding Core Components

Objective: Get acquainted with ArgoCD's architecture in the context of AWS.

Steps:

1. Explore ArgoCD Components:


- Understand the functions of the API Server, Repository Server, and Application Controller.

2. Navigate ArgoCD Ul:

-  Familiarize yourself with viewing applications, managing repositories, and monitoring deployments through the ArgoCD Ul.

3. Deploy a Sample Application:

- Use a public Git repository with Kubernetes manifests to deploy an application via ArgoCD.

- Follow the ArgoCD guide: Deploying Applications.

4. Monitor Synchronization:


- Observe how ArgoCD syncs the desired state from the Git repository to the EKS cluster.
